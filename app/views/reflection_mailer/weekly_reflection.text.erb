Congrats on another week of growth! THANK YOU for taking the time to reflect and jot down what you're learning. I personally find the daily text message 📱 prompts a great way to pull out of whatever crazy thoughts I have rattling around and take moment to recenter 🙏.

The other big part of WDYLT is taking a bit MORE time to answer some deeper reflection questions 💭. This is obviously a WIP, but for now these emails will come out on Sunday evenings. The goal? Let you look back on what you've learned and give you the chance to go a bit deeper. Try it out, and let me know what you think.

Here's what you've learned:

<% if @user_responses.count != 0%>
<% @user_responses.each do |response| %>
    <%=response.response_text%>
    
    
<% end %>
<% end %>
